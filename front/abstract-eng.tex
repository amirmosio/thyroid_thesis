    Thyroid cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the human body that affects the thyroid gland, which has different types.
    One of the main ways to diagnose this disease is to use digital slides recorded from a sample of cells.
    In this way, using the characteristics that cancer cells take on, experts can distinguish them from normal thyroid cells and determine the amount of involvement of the sample in cancer.
    In this project, we are also trying to train our model using methods based on machine learning and image processing in order to make a high-precision diagnosis using these different characteristics of cancer cells from the slides, so that it can help experts in this field.
