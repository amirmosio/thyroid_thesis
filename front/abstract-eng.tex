    Thyroid cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the human body that affects the thyroid gland, which has different types.
    One of the main ways to diagnose this disease is to use digital slides recorded from a sample of cells.
    In this way, using the characteristics that cancer cells take on, experts can distinguish them from normal thyroid cells and determine the amount of involvement of the sample in cancer.
    The aim of this project is to train a model that uses slides to make a diagnosis with high accuracy by using methods based on machine learning and image processing. Since it takes a lot of time for experts to diagnose this cancer in this way, developed model can be a great assistant and help for them.
