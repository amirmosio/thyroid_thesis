    Thyroid cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the human body that affects the thyroid gland.
    One of the main ways to diagnose this disease is to use digital slides recorded from a sample of cells.
    In this way, using the characteristics that cancer cells take on, experts can distinguish them from normal thyroid cells and determine the amount of involvement of the sample in cancer.
    The project aims to train a model that uses digital slides to perform a high-accuracy diagnosis by using \lr{ResNet} and \lr{Inception} architectures based on deep convolutional neural networks. Since it takes a lot of time for experts to diagnose this cancer in this way, the developed model can be a great assistant and help for them.
    Finally, the evaluation results obtained from training the models show the accuracy of $94.98$ for the malignant-benign classification and the accuracy of $99.72$ for the healthy-tumor classification, which shows the capacity of these methods to solve such problems.
